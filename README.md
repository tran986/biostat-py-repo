##    Description:
A biostatistics project analyzing patient data with Skin and soft tissue infection (SSI) using Python, with the overall aim to understand how SSI is related to factors, such as genders, surgical approaches, or c-reative proteins, etc... (specific questions can be found below).
The project demonstrates data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization methods for biomedical research. 
Raw data for data reproducibility can be found in the project directory

##    Research Questions:
 1. Descriptive statistics
 2. Is the presence of SSI independent (or dependent) from surgical approach?
 3. Is the presence of SSI independent (or dependent) from gender?
 4. Is there a significant difference in the rise of CRP (before and after surgery) b/w patients with and without SSI
 5. Is there a significant difference in pre-operative albumin level (PreOpAlbumin) b/w patients with and without SSI
 6. Is there a significant difference in pre-operative white cell counts b/w patients with and without SSI
